## Introduction

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its performance and efficiency. It's widely used for regression and classification tasks. In this repository, we've implemented an XGBoost model to predict Vickers Hardness, which is a crucial factor in material science and manufacturing.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate the XGBoost model, we used a dataset containing various features related to materials, including composition, processing conditions, and other properties. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Feature 1`
- `Feature 2`
- ...
- `Feature N`
- `Vickers Hardness` (target variable)

You can find the dataset in the `data` directory. The data is provided in a CSV format.

## Usage

To use this XGBoost model to predict Vickers Hardness, follow these steps:

### Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoaib-intro/materials.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd xgboost-vickers-hardness
```

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

Run below comman to star Jupyter in CLI

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once the notebook is open in your browser then anvigate to diratory and open attached notebook ending with .ipynb

### Evaluation
Test dataset is splitted into two sets 20% data used for testing. 

## Results
After training and evaluating the XGBoost model, you can expect to see performance metrics that indicate how well the model predicts Vickers Hardness. These metrics will help you assess the model's accuracy and reliability for your specific dataset.
`MSE`
`RMSE`
`MAE`
`R^2`
